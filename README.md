I want to build a vendor app that helps local street vendors connect with people in the area and allow them to come to them and buy rather than the vendors go around hours hoping to make a sell. As of right now i have the structure to act as a social media app where vendors can post updates on where they would be at to come visit. But i want to transition to a grubhub/uber eats structure where the vendor is able to send a location to those the person trusts and has been validated to be a regular/customer. They would also be able to place order within the app based on the specifc vendor customers choose. 


## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
A couple of challenges came while learning how to create the app, some examples included where I had to figure out why my button was not functioning properly when the function Changecolor was not responding under the IBA action. This was due to not connecting the button properly to the viewcontroller file, instead of choosing action I had choosen another option giving me a var connection.
